# TimeWalkCorrection (1st updated@10/24/2019)
To see how time difference between input pulse and pre-amp (to reduce time jitter)

Check the location of the input file first.

recommend: working based on anaconda installed
#
#Run the python

python -i timewalk.py

Fig1. time difference (t1-t0)

Fig2. check the pulse plot and see how it is fine to find each value.
#

to be updated

Next step will be calculation FWHM for Guas fit with (t1-t0)
